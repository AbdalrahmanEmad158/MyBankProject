# MyBankProject
this is my first repo


when you log in first 


user name is : Admin



password  is :  12345






then Show All user and update or delete or what do you want and log in with  the user you want









enum enMainMenuePermissions { eAll = -1, pListClients = 1, pAddNewClient = 2, pDeleteClient = 4, pUpdateClients = 8, pFindClient = 16, pTranactions = 32, pManageUsers = 64 };





if user has Permissions=1  that means he can only show all cliens




if user has Permissions=5  that means he can only show all cliens and DeleteClient





if user has Permissions=-1  that means he can do every thing he want







hints :

1: you can not add 2 user have the same User name 



2: you can not delete user Admin


3:  in user you can update password and Permissions only   not user name



4:  you can not add 2 client  have the same Account Number


5: in client you can update every thing except Account Number
